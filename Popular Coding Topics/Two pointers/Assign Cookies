problem:-
Assume you are an awesome parent and want to give your children some cookies. But, you should give each child at most one cookie.

Each child i has a greed factor g[i], which is the minimum size of a cookie that the child will be content with; and each cookie j has a size s[j]. If s[j] >= g[i], we can assign the cookie j to the child i, and the child i will be content. Your goal is to maximize the number of your content children and output the maximum number.


class Solution {
public:
    int findContentChildren(vector<int>& g, vector<int>& s) {
        int c=0,j=-1;
        sort(g.begin(),g.end());
        sort(s.begin(),s.end());
        for(int i=0;i<g.size();i++)
        {          
            while(++j<s.size())
            {
                if(s[j]>=g[i])
                { c++;
                break;
                }
            }
        }
        return c;
    }
};
